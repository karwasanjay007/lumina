The market is exhibiting **range-bound behavior** with modest YoY gains (+0.60%), while **IPO activity remains robust** despite secondary market stagnation[3]. Key catalysts include resilient domestic demand and strong liquidity, but concerns persist around global volatility, sector-specific headwinds (notably in IT and exporters), and valuation fatigue.\n\n",

Executive Summary\n\nThe **BSE SENSEX** currently trades at 82,126 (as of October 7, 2025), up 0.41% from the previous session but still below its all-time high of 85,978 set in September 2024[1]. The market is exhibiting **range-bound behavior** with modest YoY gains (+0.60%), while **IPO activity remains robust** despite secondary market stagnation[3]. Key catalysts include resilient domestic demand and strong liquidity, but concerns persist around global volatility, sector-specific headwinds (notably in IT and exporters), and valuation fatigue.\n\n",
